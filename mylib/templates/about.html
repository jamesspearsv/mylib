    <h2 id="title-logo">About MyLib</h2>
    <div id="content">
        <p>
            Lib was created as a final project idea for Harvard's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50x 2021</a>. 
            The project utilizes HTML, CSS, CSS Bootstrap, Javascript and Python to create a personal cataloging web app for your home library collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is inspired by and draws heavily on various book releted web resources including 
            <a href="https://www.librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, 
            and <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>. I'd highly enourage you to 
            check those out services if you are interested.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data for this web app is drawn from the Google Books API. You can check out its 
            documentation <a href="https://developers.google.com/books/">here</a>. Other APIs that were helpful during the 
            development process included the <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">Open Library API</a>.
